"""The judge pin's input, built in one place for scripts/run_daily.py (which seals
it) and scripts/rollup_day.py (which recomputes it to scope the rollup).

`capsulectl judge pin` hashes model id, prompt digest, axes digest and the flat
sampling_params map. A pin must also move when anything that changes a verdict
moves, so two more digests and the confidence threshold ride in sampling_params
(string and integer values are what `judge pin` accepts there):

  - pack_source_digest: the compiled contract's digest of its whole pack source
    (scripts/pack_compile.py:source_digest). Every criterion edit and every switch
    flip (not_applicable_verdict, done_in_full_refusal_aware, a claim_when_on
    rewording) changes it.
  - instruction_template_digest: the digest of the instruction template the judge
    command actually sends to its model, as the judge command itself reports it
    (`{"describe": true}` on stdin -> `{"instruction_template_digest": ...}`).
    judge-prompt.md is pinned too, but a judge that builds its instructions in code
    is pinned by what it sends, not by a file it may never read.
  - min_confidence_micros: the compiled judge.min_confidence, scaled to an integer
    (`judge pin` refuses floats), when set.
