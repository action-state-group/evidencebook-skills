"""Deterministic checkers for clauses whose tier switch (demo/tau2-outcomes/compiled.json's
"switches") is on -- the engine-fold plugin skills/daily-judge-and-close/SKILL.md says is
still pending, so this is the minimal seam run_daily.py uses in its place
(see RECOMPUTE_CHECKS below), not a fold registered with capsulectl-engine itself.

Each checker reads the same judge-request shape run_daily.py's judge()/judge_batch()
build -- {"clause", "case", "agent_interaction", "policy", "booking_db", ...} -- and
returns exactly what a judge returns: {"verdict", "rationale"}, verdict in
scripts/run_daily.py's VERDICTS, so run_daily.py's checked_answer() validates a
recomputed clause's answer identically to a judged one, and a bug here fails the run
closed rather than sealing a guessed verdict.

Only the rules policy.md actually states are implemented, each cited to the section of
policy.md it comes from. No fold invents a rule the policy text doesn't carry, and a
checker that doesn't have the tool-result data it needs returns not_evaluable rather
than guessing -- "absent is never pass" applies here exactly as it does in rollup.py.

within_fare_rules covers three tool-call-grounded violation shapes, combined with
rollup.combine()'s own not_met-beats-not_evaluable-beats-met precedence:
  (a) a cancel_reservation call on a reservation that doesn't meet any of policy.md's
      "Cancel flight" eligibility conditions (the 24-hour window, airline-cancelled,
      business cabin, or an insurance-covered reason) -- what the first live run's audit
      found the judge missed on task 1: Jev took the agent's "within 24 hours" claim at
      face value instead of doing the date math.
  (b) an update_reservation_flights call on a reservation that was basic_economy
      immediately before the call ("Modify flight": "Basic economy flights cannot be
      modified.").
  (c) a send_certificate call shaped like the delay-complaint gesture ($50 x
      passengers) with no accompanying change or cancel call anywhere in the
      conversation ("Refunds and Compensation": the $50 gesture is conditioned on the
      user "wanting to change or cancel the reservation" and the agent actually
      "changing or cancelling" it). $100 x passengers (the cancelled-flight gesture)
      carries no such condition. An amount that is a multiple of both $100 and $50 --
      $100 x N passengers happens to equal $50 x 2N passengers -- is disambiguated
      against the actual passenger count of any reservation seen in this conversation
      (every cancel_reservation / update_reservation_flights / update_reservation_cabin
      result that carries a "passengers" list) when one is available; only when no
      passenger count is available anywhere in the conversation does this fall back to
      guessing from the amount alone (a multiple of 100 reads as the unconditioned
      gesture) -- a heuristic, flagged as such in _check_certificate, not claimed exact.

A conversation with none of these three actions has nothing for within_fare_rules to
check and comes back met -- not not_evaluable -- the same way a judge finds nothing
wrong in a conversation that never touched a cancellation, a basic-economy change, or a
certificate.

Known, flagged gaps -- real limits of what tau2's tool-call shapes carry, not bugs in
the logic over what they do carry:

- The fourth cancellation condition ("the user has travel insurance and the reason for
  cancellation is covered") needs the stated reason classified as health/weather or
  not; tau2's cancel_reservation tool call carries no reason field (it takes only
  reservation_id -- confirmed against every cancel_reservation call in
  airline-data/*.json), so the reason, if it matters at all, only exists as free text in
  the user's own turns. It is checked here with a keyword match, only when insurance is
  "yes" (otherwise this condition is moot and the keyword search never runs) --
  a heuristic, not a semantic read. tau2 carries no structured link between a user turn
  and the cancellation it explains, so this is scoped to _user_text_before(): the user's
  turns since the last tool result before the cancel_reservation call, not the whole
  conversation -- an unrelated health/weather word earlier in the conversation (small
  talk, an old complaint about a different flight) no longer flips this condition true;
  only a mention in the turns immediately motivating this specific cancellation can.
  Still a heuristic, not a semantic read of which reservation or complaint the words
  refer to, flagged as such rather than claimed as exact.
- send_certificate's own arguments carry no reservation_id (confirmed against every
  send_certificate call in airline-data/*.json: {"user_id", "amount"} only), so the
  "accompanying change or cancel action" check below cannot confirm the change/cancel
  acted on the *same* reservation the certificate compensates -- it can only confirm one
  happened somewhere in the conversation. A conversation touching two reservations,
  where the certificate compensates one and the change/cancel acts on the other, reads
  as met when it should not. There is no tool-call data in this conversation shape to
  close this gap.

    true on any user turn and STAYS true across a directly-chained run of
    write calls -- covering the real shape policy.md's rule is tested
    against: a single "Yes, cancel both" confirms a whole sequence of write
    calls described together, not just the one immediately following it.
    `pending` is only spent by a later assistant message that carries new
    substantive content (a fresh proposal) and no tool call of its own --
    at that point a further write needs its own new pending-setting turn.

    WHAT THIS DOES NOT CHECK, named precisely rather than implied by the
    "met" rationale text: policy.md's rule has two clauses -- "list the
    action details" AND "obtain explicit user confirmation (yes)." This
    checker verifies neither in isolation; it verifies only the weaker,
    structural proxy "a user turn, not solely the agent's own unprompted
    initiative, precedes this write call (or the confirmed chain it belongs
    to)." A user's ORIGINAL request ("please cancel reservation R1"),
    immediately actioned with no detail-listing and no separate "yes" ever
    spoken, satisfies `pending` exactly as a genuine "Yes, go ahead" reply to
    a prior listed proposal would -- the two are structurally identical (a
    user turn, then a write), and telling them apart is a semantic read of
    whether the agent's own words constitute "listing the action details."
    That is exactly why the pack keeps a judged row (art26j)
    alongside this recomputed one for consequential actions against the
    prose instructions, not a second deterministic rule -- this checker
    deliberately does not substitute a confirmation-keyword search ("yes",
    "go ahead", "confirm") for that judgment, since tau2's own user-simulator
    text is open-ended enough that a keyword list would under- or over-match
    in either direction with no real grounding. The one shape this DOES catch
    deterministically, and the only one `not_met` is reachable for: a write
    call with no preceding user turn anywhere in the conversation, or a fresh
    assistant-only proposal since the last one -- the agent acting on its own
    initiative with no user turn in the picture at all.

    Confirmed against tau2:airline:task-7:trial-0 and task-9:trial-0
    (tests/test_recompute.py): "Yes, cancel both IFOYYZ and NQNU5R" confirms
    two chained cancel_reservation calls with no further user turn between
    them -- the literal immediately-preceding-message version of this check
    (an earlier draft) flagged the second call not_met, a false positive this
    pass-based version does not make.

    Known, flagged gap (the mirror image of the fix above, same root cause
    as the paragraph above it): a write call the agent bundles, UNREQUESTED,
    into the same message as a prior pending-covered write's own narration
    ("Done. I'll also cancel reservation R2, which I notice is basic economy"
    + a cancel_reservation call in one message) reads as covered too, because
    `pending` is only spent by a content-bearing message with NO tool call
    of its own. Not fabricated to pass a test: left as a named, understood
