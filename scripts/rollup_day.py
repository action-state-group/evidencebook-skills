"""Where the all-required rollup (scripts/rollup.py) meets the book: read every
evaluation-report/v1 capsule scripts/run_daily.py sealed for this --spec's clauses,
group by case, and for every case with every clause, compute the per-check and
all-required verdicts plus a Result v0 document (scripts/result_v0.py) -- the input
`capsulectl result build` takes.

Pack-driven: the check groupings, the full criteria set, each clause's EFFECTIVE
tier (its tier_switch applied) and the never_not_applicable set all come from
--spec's own clauses[] and switches, never from code here.

Pin-scoped whenever a judge model id is available (--judge-model-id, or
spec["judge"]["model_id"]): a judged report counts only under the CURRENT judge pin
(scripts/judge_pin.py, recomputed here exactly as run_daily.py builds it, which
needs --judge-cmd to report its instruction template), and a recomputed report
only under the current pack_source_digest. A clause reworded but kept at the same
id is therefore never combined with an older judgment of it.

Conflicts are refused, not resolved by order: two reports under one pin for the
same case and clause with different verdicts (a re-judgment that disagrees) put
the case under "cases_conflicting" and keep it out of every rollup. Nothing is
dropped silently: every case left out of a day document is listed with its reason
in that day's "cases_skipped".

This script SEALS NOTHING: it is a read of the book plus a pure computation,
written to --out as plain files.

Writes one JSON file per fully-judged case (rollup + the Result v0 document), one
